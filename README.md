This is a beginner's crash course on GenAI. This repo will outline a roadmap and a step-by-step journey for a beginner. This repo will contains GenAI Theory, Workshops, Guides, Cool Open Source Projects and contribution area. This was inspired by the learning resources and roadmap provided by Ms.Lillian Pierson in 100 Days of GenAI Challenge LinkedIn Group. This page will evolve as i continue down my exploratory learning and upskilling path in Gen-AI. Everyone is more than welcome to submit a pull request for helpful learning resources so that this repo can grow and become richer ✨🎉🎐🎨.
